Placing the explosive requires a PER + Explosives test with a difficulty of 1; this increases to 2 if you’ve been attacked since your last turn. Failure means the bomb hasn’t been set properly and will not detonate (or, if a complication is rolled, may have been set improperly, and may detonate unexpectedly).
